## step 1: Choose a bread that you like
There are many different types of bread that you can use to make your sandwich, and it depends on your preferences. 

For normal sandwich, these are a few you can consider:
* White bread
* Rye

For ***fancier*** sandwiches, you can consider using the following bread:
* Ciabatta
* Italian
* French Baguatte
* Brioche

## step 2: Find out what protein you want inside the sandwich
Once you have decided the type of bread you want, the next step is to choose the type of protein you want in the sandwich!

the most basic kind of protein would be ham. It is tasty and easy to pack into a sandwich

next up we have roasted chicken. this will take more preparation and also harder to pack into a sandwich due to its size.

for non-meat options, we can use cheese or tofu as well!


## step 3: Get your greens!
How can we forget about the vegetables in the sandwich?

Veggies in your sandwich help to add texture and some extra nutrients into your meal. Furthermore, it also adds more color to the sandwich which makes it looks more appetizing as well!

Some popular options are:
* lettuce
* tomato
* onions
* Cucumber
* Bell peppers

## step 4: Flavor up  with some sauces
Last but not least, choosing the correct sauce can greatly enhance the taste of your sandwich. Most people use store bought sauces like mayonaise, ranch but did you know that you can also make your own sauces at home too? Not only is it healthier, it is also cheaper and you can control the flavors exactly to what you like! Win-win scenario!


> **Secret of the perfect sandwich:**
 Everyone has their favorite techniques, but here are a handful of tips to make your sandwich next-level great:
> * Use quality condiments. Swap out a spicy aioli in place of mayonnaise, or try pesto, chutney, or a pepper jelly. Conversely, you can keep it simple but add some interest by buttering your bread and grilling it before assembling your sandwich.
> * Use a mix of textures. If your bread is crunchy, consider softer ingredients, and vice versa.
> * Spread the condiments out. Instead of slapping a bunch of mayo onto one slice of bread, use the same amount of mayo but spread it onto both slices as well as onto the protein.
> * Add some salt and pepper to your lettuce and your vegetables
> * Warm up the protein to release the flavors and get a more pleasing mouth feel.
